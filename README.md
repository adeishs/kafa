Get a random non-English translation of ‘coffee’ using MyMemory API.

# History

It started as a joke between myself and [@kva1966](https://github.com/kva1966).
This tool automates this.

# Running

You need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) installed, simply run:

```bash
ruby kafa.rb
```

Alternatively, if you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/),
you can run:

```bash
docker compose run --rm kafa
```

The first run will take a while as it builds the image. Subsequent ones will be
faster and just display the output.
